# Pug Trail
**C++ SFML Snake-Based Game**
Dedicated for my one year anniversary with Nina Dionisio and her obsession with pugs.

**Brief introduction:**
This is my first experience with implementing graphics and sounds alongside C++. During this process, I learned how to keep track of multiple screens at once and how to implement sounds and how to use the GUI to toggle sounds off and on. I was able to create a user-friendly GUI and create a snake-based game that also kept track of scores. Many things were a first to me in this project so all user feedback would be greatly appreciated in hopes for creating more effecient coding practices. Thank you.
